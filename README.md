# Vehicle Speed Detection and Monitoring System

A real-time computer vision system that detects vehicles, monitors their speed, and identifies speed violations using YOLOv8. The system provides instant visual feedback and detailed analytics for traffic monitoring.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time vehicle detection (cars and buses)
- Accurate speed calculation and monitoring
- Speed violation detection (threshold: 80 km/h)
- Color-coded visual indicators (green: compliant, red: violation)
- Compact on-screen display of vehicle information
- Detailed data logging and analytics
- CSV report generation for individual vehicles and summary statistics

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- YOLOv8 for object detection
- OpenCV for image processing
- EasyOCR for text recognition
- Pandas for data analysis
- NumPy for numerical computations

## 📋 Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Sufficient disk space for video processing
- Compatible GPU recommended for better performance

## 🔧 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
